#Pattern Views

Pattern Views enable cross Pattern Language relations. A Pattern View can contain subsets of Patterns from multiple Pattern Languages.
A Pattern View has its own [Pattern Graph](../user_guide/pattern-graph.md) and [Pattern Relations](../user_guide/pattern-relations.md)
A detailed introduction to Pattern Views can be found [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64846-6_6).
