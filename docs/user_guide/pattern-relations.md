#Pattern Relations

Relations are used to link two different Patterns. The following attributes get used to specify the Relation:

* **Direction**: A relation between 2 Patterns can be directional or undirectional.
* **Relationtype**: A relation has a type. Selectable types are for example: isRelatedTo, isUsedBefore, isUsedAfter, dependsOn, isAlternativeOf, and many more. Custom type inputs are also possible.
* **Description**: The description contains further information about the relation.
